# Artemis
Created in 24 hours during an anti-violence Hackathon, Artemis is designed to increase the visibility of crime in San Francisco and help people make informed decisions about their safety. The user enters an address and is presented with several heat maps of crime in the area and a breakdown on the type of crime. Built as a Ruby on Rails application with a firebase database.
